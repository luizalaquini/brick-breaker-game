### About
Breakout classic, originally released in 1976 for Atari. Successfully conceived, several versions of the game have appeared since then. Our version is singleplayer. The player has a limited number of lifes to beat all the levels, which get more and more difficult. Each level has several blocks, which can have different strengths according to their color. 

Controls: left arrow and right arrow or A and D to move the paddle; space to release the ball.
